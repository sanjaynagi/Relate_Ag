Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 11 of /home/sanj/ag1000g/Relate/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
data/shapeit/ag1000g.phase2.ar1.haplotypes.2L.biallelic.gz
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
